[{"full_text": "\u201cWhile the Supreme Court is often the focus of public attention,\u201d the chief justice wrote in the report, released on Saturday, \u201cour system of justice depends fundamentally on the skill, hard work and dedication of those outside the limelight.\u201d He said the job of a trial judge was in some ways harder than his own. For starters, \u201cthe typical federal judge has more than 500 cases on the docket,\u201d an amount that he called \u201ca daunting workload.\u201d A trial judge\u2019s work, he added, presents many vexing challenges. \u201cDistrict judges are the first to encounter novel issues, and they must resolve them without the aid of guiding precedent,\u201d the chief justice wrote. \u201cBecause they work alone, district judges do not have the benefit of collegial decision-making or the comfort of shared consensus. And because of the press of their dockets, they face far more severe time and resource constraints than their appellate brethren.\u201d Other statistics reflected a strengthening economy, with bankruptcy filings dropping to their lowest level since 2007. \u201cFrom 2007 to 2010, bankruptcy filings rose steadily,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote, \u201cbut they have fallen in each of the last six years.\u201d Most cases in the district courts end in plea bargains, settlements or pretrial dismissals. But the few that go to trial, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, present special challenges to district court judges. \u201cAs the singular authority on the bench, he must respond to every detail of an unscripted proceeding, tempering firm and decisive judgment with objectivity, insight and compassion,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \u201cThis is no job for impulsive, timid or inattentive souls.\u201d Critics say the overhaul placed excessively strict limits on the pretrial exchange of information that lawyers call discovery, and made it too easy for judges to dismiss cases at their earliest stages. But Chief Justice Roberts said the new rules gave district court judges important tools to control their dockets. \u201cThe reforms are beginning to have a positive effect because already extremely busy judges are willing to undertake more active engagement in managing their dockets, which will pay dividends down the road,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \u201cA lumberjack saves time when he takes the time to sharpen his ax.\u201d", "headline": "Chief Justice Salutes Trial Judges for Tackling \u2018Daunting Workload\u2019", "descriptors": ["Courts and the Judiciary", "Suits and Litigation (Civil)"], "section": "U.S.", "locations": [], "word_count": "605", "snippet": "Chief Justice John G.
