       " u'full_text': u'I\\u2019ve buried my phone at the bottom of my purse so I can try to ignore the calls, emails and texts from well-meaning relatives, all of whom are asking: Where is the Christmas list? They want suggestions for what to give the kids, the more specific the better. If I say, \\u201cMaybe a Lego set?\\u201d they\\u2019ll ask, \\u201cWhich one?\\u201d I think it\\u2019s about longing: to be taken care of, to let someone else do at least part of the planning. I may be an adult, but some part of me still has a child\\u2019s desire to wake up, starry-eyed, and find that gifts have materialized under the tree \\u2014 surprises chosen with love and obtained in secret, waiting to be opened in wonder. We don\\u2019t outgrow that. Then there\\u2019s the guilt, of course. I suspect our relatives wouldn\\u2019t need ideas for what to give our children if I did a better job of keeping in touch during the rest of the year. If we visited more often \\u2014 if I were a better daughter and sister \\u2014 they\\u2019d know all my kids\\u2019 hobbies and wishes, and I would know theirs. (I haven\\u2019t asked anyone what to give them this year. I hope they don\\u2019t hate their gifts, but I really do enjoy putting a little imagination into it.) This is also a practical matter. To compile an itemized inventory of wished-for things and divvy it up among grandparents and aunts and uncles would require time, of which I have no surplus. Tonight, for example, I have four events to attend \\u2014 two optional-but-encouraged work functions, a fund-raiser for my children\\u2019s school, and an already rescheduled social gathering. I don\\u2019t know if our 13-year-old son\\u2019s soccer game will finish in time for the first event or at what point in the evening my husband\\u2019s meeting will let out so that he can come home to watch our 10-year-old daughter. I don\\u2019t know what anyone\\u2019s going to eat for dinner or when, much less what everyone\\u2019s getting for Christmas. Where\\u2019s the line between writing a letter to the North Pole and forking over an itemized file of material desires? The former seems sweet; the latter feels like handing someone a grocery list. Plus, if you ask only for things you know exist, how will you ever be delighted by something you couldn\\u2019t have fathomed? Still, it\\u2019s my job as a parent to orchestrate all the steps that make Christmas look like magic, and that means I have to make the decisions. We\\u2019re lucky to have family who love our kids, who want to do something nice for them, and I know it\\u2019s ungrateful not to return their calls. So I dig the phone out of my purse. \\u201cAnything is fine, really,\\u201d I try to tell my mom. \\u201cThey like everything. Maybe clothes?\\u201d \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t help me,\\u201d she says. That\\u2019s when I realize she\\u2019s feeling some variation of the same thing I am: Help me. Make this easier, please. Tell me what to do. At the end of the school day, my daughter climbs into the car. Thanks to her brother\\u2019s sports schedule, she has done homework on bleachers and back seats for three of the past four nights. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s for dinner?\\u201d she asks. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure yet,\\u201d I say. \\u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\\u201d \\u201cWhatever,\\u201d she says. \\u201cYou pick.\\u201d She wants me to decide. I want someone else to decide. My mother wants me to decide. We don\\u2019t grow out of this either, apparently. I make a decision: No events tonight. Not one, not two, not three, not four. I make the calls and beg off. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry. I wish I could come.\\u201d And it\\u2019s true; I wish I could be many places at once. But I can\\u2019t. We go to the soccer game. We come home. I make spaghetti. Father and son hang out after homework and talk about whether the deer in our yard have enough to eat when it turns cold. My daughter and I share a blanket on the sofa. She\\u2019s braiding the fringe when I ask, \\u201cIf Mimi\\u201d \\u2013 her grandmother \\u2013 \\u201cwanted to give you something you really liked for Christmas, do you have any ideas for her?\\u201d She looks up and ponders for a moment, then says, \\u201cMaybe a few yards of fabric? I want to make a cape.\\u201d I reach for paper and pen, start making a list. That wasn\\u2019t so hard. \\u201cWhat else?\\u201d I ask.',\n",
